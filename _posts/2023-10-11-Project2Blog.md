## Project 2 Blog
To summarize the things I did in this vignette, I built functions to interact with some of the Monster Hunter World API endpoints, retrieved some of the data, and explored it using tables, numerical summaries, and data visualization. I found some unsurprising things, like that within some categories rarity of items appeared to predict the value of items. I also found some surprising things, such as how, overall, item rarity was a weak predictor of value.

Possibly the most difficult and frustrating aspect of doing this project was finding an API that: 1 - Is still currently functional, 2 - Produced results in an easy to process way (I am a huge NBA fan and was looking forward to creating a project that analyzed NBA player statistics and maybe produced something useful for predicting fantasy sports scores or something like that, but the BallDon'tLie API produced paginated results, the NBA Stats API didn't seem to work, and I even signed up for a trial key of the SportsRadar API, but it also had issues.  This process took days.  So, I went with the next API that I found that produced usable results and had some numeric variables that could be analyzed) and, 3 - Had a sufficient number of numeric variables that could be used for plots.  Hopefully, when we get to making APIs this semester, I will be able to make some kind of usable NBA API...  In the future, if doing this same project again, I would forget trying to find an interesting API and just start searching through APIs that look like they have numeric variables for one that is working and produces usable query results.
