BIO: Hello All,

My name is Ryan Craft.  I used to be a neuroscience researcher for psychiatric and neurological diseaes at the University of California, San Francisco.  But, did not want the life of a primary investigator, always worrying about publishing and grants.  So, I made a career change to a middle and high school science teacher. As many of you can imagine, this is not the most rewarding career, definitely not living up to the dream of walking into a classroom and opening young minds to the wonders of science, but rather more of yelling at students to stop trying to do tik-tok dances in the middle of class time.  So, with a background in neuroscience research and data analysis, this seems like a natural transition.  This is my story.

Here's a list of things I care about most:
*My wife
*My puppy
*Living a healthy and happy life
