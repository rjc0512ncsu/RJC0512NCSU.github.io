BIO: Hello All,

My name is Ryan Craft.  I'm currently a middle and high school science teacher.  As many of you can imagine, this is not the most rewarding career, definitely not living up to the dream of walking into a classroom and opening young minds to the wonders of science, but rather more of yelling at students to stop trying to do tik-tok dances in the middle of class time.  So, with a background in neuroscience research and data analysis, this seems like a natural transition.  This is my story.
